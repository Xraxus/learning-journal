          <h1>Hello there! My name is <span>Kamil</span> and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
          <p>After completing my bachelor's degree in Digital Information Processing at the Jagiellonian University, I’ve decided to expand my front-end skills & knowledge in order to get hired as  a junior developer.</p>

          <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
          <p>
            I’m currently a part of Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path, I
            spend hours and hours learning and improving my coding skills by
            progressing the course and creating solo projects. I love to track
            my progress via focus time tracking apps such as Focus Tree or
            Forest Honing my programming skills is so much fun! I’d like
            document this journey and share it with the world.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>How it got started</h2>
          <p>
            It all started on my first year of college back in 2020. That’s when
            I’ve written my first Hello Worlds and created my first website.
            It’s also when I fell in love with programming and decided that I
            want to work in IT. Even though learning to code wasn’t always easy,
            the thought of my hobby becoming a job kept me on track!
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The new goal</h2>
          <p>
            Now that I gained my degree and I’m free to explore different
            technologies I decided to learn modern JavaScript - the language
            that always fascinated me, but I mainly worked in back-end
            technologies before.
